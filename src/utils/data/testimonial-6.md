From the first time I experienced Kambo with Tao Te Kambo, I felt the deep magic and beautiful Spirit of this sacred medicine. After Kambo, I feel grounded, energetic, clear-headed, inspired and happy. I also feel like I am able to connect more deeply to the flow state. Whether Iâ€™m surfing, playing guitar, teaching yoga, or teaching children, I am able to completely tune into the present moment and feel at One with all things. I have been fortunate enough to receive Kambo 9 times with Scott and Alex over the past year and have watched them conduct even more ceremonies on my property in Hawaii. They have always been kind, nurturing, immensely supportive and highly concerned with the safety of everyone in their circles.
