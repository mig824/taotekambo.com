I recently completed a two-year cycle since I started working with Kambo. This sacred medicine brought me back to my true self. As my teacher, it showed me how to listen to my body, clear old habits, and patterns that were limiting my growth and causing dis-ease within. For many years I had intense migraines, stomach pains, and dealing with the consequences of decades being morbidly obese. I have shed 80 lbs. of disease and inflammation since I started working with Kambo. Scott and Alex supported me through this entire journey and I have so much admiration and gratitude for all the work they do. Thank you for creating such a safe space.
