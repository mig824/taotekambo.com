I came in not knowing too much about Kambo. I did a little research. My friend told me about her experience briefly. However, nothing is like your own experience and intention to why you choose to do so. My experience of Kambo brought me to the middle and it was the best thing Iâ€™ve invested into my spiritual being. I had to allow myself to be open to the experience and be committed to the journey. Kambo has added value to my life. I am so grateful for the practitioner who gave me a safe space to purge generational curses into an empowering movement in living my best life in how I see fit.
