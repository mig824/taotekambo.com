I have sat in Ceremony and received medicine for Scott somewhere around 20 times. I’ve received medicine from a few other people before, and I will never sit with anybody but Scott again. He is highly intuitive, gentle, humble, and a natural healer and the medicine works powerfully through him; but also more gently than it does with others. When I sit with him it feels like a very sacred experience, and I know he has my highest intention and healing in mind. He always says something really powerful right before he applies the medicine, and it’s always perfect for me on that exact day, in that exact moment. I cannot recommend him highly enough.
