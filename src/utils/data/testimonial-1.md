So thankful for the relationship I have been building with this sacred medicine. Thank you Kambo for all that you have helped me with. Releasing what no longer serves me and all that you have brought to me...knowledge, experience, perspective, connection, prosperity. And thank you to my brother @taotekambo for facilitating this sacred medicine with integrity and always creating a safe space. If you feel called to sit with this medicine or have any questions I highly recommend reaching out to @taotekambo Iâ€™ve done almost every one of my ceremonies with him and they have been beyond amazing. Gracias medicina!
